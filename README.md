# Basketball-Tracker-and-Game-Analyzer

- Performs ball tracking on basketball footages utilizing mean shift tracking

- The "Expansion Algorithm" is created soley for this project, it solves the problem of the tracker losing the ball when it temporarily dissapears in the footage. The Expansion Algorithm is a far more easier concept to understand and to implement in this project than the likes of Kalman Filters.

- The concept details of mean shift tracking and the Expansion Algorithm are thoroughly documented in the PDF file.
